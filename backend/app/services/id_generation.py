Resident/house code generation.

Per PROJECT_ROADMAP.md Section 6.3:
- Owner code:  "{house_code}-O"
- Tenant code: "{house_code}-T{n}", n auto-incrementing per house

These are only ever called from the registration-approval service, never
from the registration (self-signup) path — codes are server-generated
after Housing Office approval, never client-supplied or pre-verification.
